Description: A reflection on whether our digital tools are building walls instead of bridges.
---
<p>Walk through the cafeteria during lunch, and you'll see a familiar sight: tables of friends sitting together, but instead of talking, many are staring down at their phones, scrolling through endless feeds. Social media promised to connect us all, but has it delivered on that promise? Or has it built invisible walls between us, replacing genuine conversation with performative posts and fleeting likes?</p><p>I believe we are losing the art of conversation. We've become more comfortable with carefully crafted text messages than with the spontaneous, sometimes awkward, but ultimately more rewarding experience of face-to-face interaction. We are curating our lives for an online audience, but we may be neglecting the people sitting right next to us.</p><h3>A Challenge for Us All</h3><p>This isn't an attack on technology, but a call for mindfulness. I challenge you: next time you're with your friends, put the phone away. Ask a real question. Listen to the answer. Make eye contact. Let's work to make our real-life connections as strong as our online ones. The digital world can wait.</p>
