<p>The Andover Warriors are district champions. In a nail-biting final that will be remembered for years, the Warriors defeated the Northwood Rangers 21-20 in overtime, securing their first district title in over a decade. The stadium was electric, a sea of blue and gold, as quarterback Leo Martinez scored the winning touchdown on a daring fourth-down run.</p><p>The game was a defensive battle from the start, with both teams trading blows but struggling to find the end zone. The Rangers struck first with a field goal in the second quarter, but the Warriors answered just before halftime with a touchdown pass to star receiver Chloe Davis. The second half was just as tense, leading to a 14-14 tie at the end of regulation, a testament to the grit of both defenses.</p><h3>A Gutsy Final Play</h3><p>In overtime, Northwood settled for a field goal, putting immense pressure on the Andover offense. On fourth-and-goal from the two-yard line, instead of kicking a game-tying field goal, Coach Miller put his faith in his senior quarterback. Martinez faked the handoff and rolled to his right, finding a sliver of daylight and diving past the pylon for the score, sending the home crowd into a frenzy.</p><p>\"I saw the opening and I just went for it,\" a breathless Martinez said after the game. \"This team... we never give up. This is for everyone. For the school, for the town. We did it.\" The victory marks a stunning turnaround for a program that went 2-8 just three seasons ago, and solidifies Coach Miller's reputation as a master strategist.</p>
