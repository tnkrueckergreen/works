Description: An argument for prioritizing student well-being over administrative convenience.
---
<p>The 7:30 a.m. start time is a long-standing tradition at Andover High, but it's a tradition based on outdated logistics, not on the well-being of students. It's time to have a serious conversation about pushing the first bell back. The scientific evidence is overwhelming: teenagers are biologically wired to go to bed later and wake up later. Forcing them into an early-morning school schedule is detrimental to their health, safety, and academic performance.</p><p>Studies from the American Academy of Pediatrics show that chronic sleep deprivation in teens is linked to higher rates of depression, anxiety, obesity, and car accidents. Schools that have shifted to later start times—typically 8:30 a.m. or later—report that students are more alert in class, attendance improves, and graduation rates increase. Opponents often cite challenges with bus schedules and after-school sports, but these are logistical hurdles, not insurmountable barriers. Numerous districts across the country have successfully navigated these issues by adjusting schedules and finding creative solutions.</p><h3>Prioritizing Student Well-Being Over Convenience</h3><p>Our school's primary mission is to educate. By ignoring the science of adolescent sleep, we are actively undermining that mission. A later start time is not about coddling students; it's about creating an environment where they can learn effectively and thrive. It's a proactive, evidence-based policy change that would benefit the entire school community. The well-being of students must be the priority, not administrative convenience.</p>
