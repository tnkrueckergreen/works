<p>While the actors on stage for "Into the Woods" received thunderous applause, an equally talented team worked silently in the shadows to make the magic happen. The Andover Stage Crew, a dedicated group of over 20 students, are the unsung heroes of every theater production, and their work on the fall musical was nothing short of professional.</p><h3>Masters of the Backstage</h3><p>Led by senior Stage Manager Leo Petrov, the crew was responsible for everything from building the rotating sets to programming the complex lighting cues and managing over 100 props. "Our job is to make sure everything runs so smoothly that the audience doesn't even know we're here," Petrov explained during a break. "It's high-pressure, but seeing it all come together is the best feeling in the world." From sound engineers to set painters, these students demonstrate that some of the biggest stars at Andover High are behind the curtain.</p>
