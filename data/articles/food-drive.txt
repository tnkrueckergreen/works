<p>Andover High students have once again shown their incredible generosity, collecting a record-breaking 3,500 non-perishable food items during the annual Fall Food Drive. The two-week event, organized by the Student Council, supports the Andover Community Food Pantry, which helps hundreds of local families in need, especially as the holiday season approaches.</p><p>Competition between homerooms was fierce but friendly, with Ms. Gable's senior homeroom ultimately winning the coveted pizza party prize by bringing in 450 items. "I'm just so proud of these kids," said Student Council advisor Mr. Davis. "They understand the importance of giving back to the community that supports them. This year's total is the highest we've ever had. It's a testament to their character." The donations were delivered to the pantry on Friday, where volunteers expressed their immense gratitude.</p>
