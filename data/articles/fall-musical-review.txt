<p>The Andover High Drama Club delivered a masterful performance with their fall production of Stephen Sondheim's "Into the Woods." For three nights, the auditorium was transformed into an enchanted, fairy-tale world where wishes come true, but not without consequences. The production was a triumph of acting, singing, and technical stagecraft.</p><p>Leading the cast were seniors Maya Singh as the Witch and Evan Lee as the Baker. Singh's portrayal of the Witch was a showstopper, capturing both her terrifying power and her tragic vulnerability. Her rendition of "Last Midnight" was both chilling and heartbreaking, earning a standing ovation each night. Lee provided the show's emotional core, perfectly conveying the Baker's journey from a simple man to a reluctant hero.</p><h3>More Than Just a Show</h3><p>The entire ensemble was superb, and the clever, minimalist set design—featuring rotating platforms and evocative projections—allowed the actors' performances to shine. The orchestra, conducted by Mr. Harrison, flawlessly navigated Sondheim's notoriously complex score. "Into the Woods" was more than a school play; it was a piece of high-caliber theater that left audiences both entertained and deeply moved, reminding us all to be careful what we wish for.</p>
